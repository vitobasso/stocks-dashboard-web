### wip
migrate localStorage

### click ticker
- list of links

### click cell on derived values should explain the calc (and give multiple links if needed)

### upgrade node and friends
also tsconfig.json target to ES2020 (+performance, less old browser compatibility)

### search tickers by key
e.g. lucro > X, top X lucro, ... 

### column-selector: group by source
still 2 levels: source and keys 
but subgroup keys and always expand them all
making sure top-level group has the check/semi-check

### [bug] zeros not being colored red
tag along, simplywall score

### [bug] showing "0" instead of "-"

### [perf] cache data and meta in the browser: faster reloads & fetch the diff only

### calc projecao: aggregate yahoo + tradingview

### import b3 automatically

### views
duplicate
reorder tabs

### when importing b3, add all tickers (ask confirmation)

### order by multi cols

### customize: color rules ?

### customize: calculated columns ?

### test
